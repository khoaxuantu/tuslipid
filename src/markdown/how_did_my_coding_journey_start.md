## Before Knowing About Programming

> Let me tell my story first...

My undergraduate major is Mechanical Engineering, simply 95% of the courses are not related to
programming. Well, thermodynamics and manufacturing processes made my day. ðŸ’€

It took me around 2 years to accept that being a mechanical engineer is not my ideal career path.
That was when the 5% left me a choice.

In my sophomore year (2020), I learned a course called *Programming Language*, about C. That was the
first time I found a joy in problem solving. Starting from the ASMR of keyboard typing, combined
with the satisfaction when the screen shows the ***Compiled successfully*** message, and the green result.
Everything was perfect. I had found my passion in programming.

> Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

> Btw, my high school class was specialized in History. I'm confident to discuss any aspect

That was how my coding journey started, quite late compared with other computer science peers.

## When Graduation

In 2022, I graduated and achieved the Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering, with no failed
courses through the whole 4 years. That sounds great, but for the path opened from this degree, I
did not want to go any further. Not that I hated it; it just was not suitable to me.

Instead, my focus was on the code, the computer, and the software - I wanted to become a Software
Engineer. I had graduated; it supposed to be the time to start my first job, and it must be
programming-related one. This was the critical choice that will decide my future, absolutely. ðŸ˜¤

However, things were not that easy. My programming experience was almost zero. At that time, I had
no completed programming project; my knowledge was so limited. I found it so difficult to solve a medium
Leetcode question; my C was just enough to write a simple [calendar](https://github.com/khoaxuantu/Calendar_demo);
my Python was just enough to pass a Machine Learning course. I even knew nothing about HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

My resume was a blank page.

I saw that there would be a very long way to go until I received the first offer. That was a
stressful journey, definitely.

What did I do next? Deciding my specialization path and starting over.

I was weak on Leetcode, so I started learning data structures & algorithms from scratch again and
practiced it day by day.

I decided to focus on web development, so I learned the frontend, the backend, the database, and how all
of these work together. I learned Docker, touched on the first level of an application's environment, and
studied how an app is packaged and delivered. I learned about Google Cloud Service for the first
time, opened a new world about cloud services, and hosted my first project.

Just like that, I fulfilled any lacking part in my resume.

After my graduation, due to the Taiwan immigration regulation, I can only extend my resident certificate
one more year to find a job, which will sponsor another working Alien Resident Certificate for
foreigners. If I can find a new job in one year, I can stay; otherwise, it's time to go back home.

So besides strengthening my skills, I had to seek every opportunity as long as it is programming-related.

Well, that time was also the market-downtrend time; my competitors for a new-grad position more than a
half were master's degree candidates, or junior-middle engineers who already had 1-3 years of working
experiences... Whatever ðŸ’€ I only knew to try.

One month.

Two months.

Three months...

Nothing. One time, I was invited to interview with ASUS for a New-grad Backend Engineer position.
Passing 2 coding interview rounds, that was the farthest I could go.

Four months.

Five months...

Ten months...

Only two months left until my resident certificate expired, and still no offer. Finally, I decided not
to take any more risks and came back to my hometown in Hanoi, seeking my first job here.

## Back to Home

> Why did I not go home right after graduation?
>
> Why not? I still had one more year to live in Taiwan. Every experience at that time was valuable

> Even I knew that having my desired job was almost impossible; I still wanted to try. It
> promoted me to achieve the huge amount of knowledge and to build a strong base in a short time.

June 2023, eleven months after my graduation, I received my first offer for a junior web developer
position.

Since then, my personal development has grown rapidly; I learned a new programming language (Ruby) and
worked with Amazon Web Service for the first time. So many interesting things came.

Now, four years after I started the first line of code, I take on a main responsibility in developing
a small product, with around 6000-user base. Can't wait to see many challenges in the future!
