Last week I had the change to travel to Shanghai. It had been more than 2 years since I was last
abroad.

This time, I only stayed in Shanghai for nearly a week. Although it was like a blink of an eye
compared to my 5-year "trip" in Taipei, I still made a lot of meaningful memories there.

## An oopsie when checking in the flight

😛

Believe or not, I was almost failed to check in due to this stupid mistake:

**_My name in the flight booking was not similar to my name in the visa._**

In the ticket, my name was Tu Nguyen, which accidentally omitted my middle name, and for an unknown
reason, I ignored it carelessly as well. Until being rejected by the checkin counter, I just had
known that my name was wrong.

It would be nothing to tell if I was rejected a couple of days before the take-off schedule. But at
that time, I only had 2 hours left until the plane took off.

That was tough. I had to contact the airline customer support to change my name in every way.
Luckily, my ticket was updated in time and I was accepted in the very last minute.

> A lesson to check your flight information carefully :)

## Landing at Shanghai

My flight took off at 15:00 (GMT +7:00) and landed at 19:20 (GMT +8:00).

I landed at Shanghai. The entry procedure seem pretty complexed but fast, the customs officer was
friendly as well. I remembered a small conversation between me and the customs officer when she
saw my visa going to Taiwan in my passport.

```
海關：你來中國做什麼呢？
阿秀：我來參加一個活動，我不會中文名字怎麼說，你看看我的漂。
海關：哦！是Google的活動。😲

「看者我的護照」

海關：你是那裡念中文的？
阿秀：台灣
海關：哦！你是住在台灣嗎？
阿秀：沒了。現在我住在我的國家，越南的。以前我在台灣念大學啊。
海關：哦！是念什麼哦？
阿秀：是念工程的。
海關：你是念大學幾年的？
阿秀：四年。後來我有一年作實習。最後回越南啊。
海關：好的！你可以過去了！😊

## Sightseeing Shanghai China Art Museum

The next day, besides setting up my Alipay, I got some free time in the afternoon. So I decided to
go somewhere...

Shanghai has plenty of tourist attractions to go to in several days. The first place I chose to
visit was the Shanghai China Art Museum.

The museum uses an inverted pyramid architecture, which is the same architecture with the Hanoi
Museum. The funny thing is both structures were built in the same year, 2010. So it ended up with
an endless debates between Vietnamese and Chinese folks about who copied each other. LOL.

## Google I/O Connect China

Here comes the main stage of my trip.

Actually, I planned to travel to Shanghai mostly because I got a chance to join Google I/O Connect
China 2025.

This is the biggest localised conference quoting the latest announcements from Google I/O 2025
across Android, AI, web, cloud, and more. It attracted thousands of developers and experts from not
only China but also around the Asia-Pacific regions.

This time, the Vietnamese joining the party had a Google community manager, 8 GDEs, and 4 GDG
organizers, including me.

## At Shanghai Bund

After the event, I finished my travelling with a visit to the most well-known attraction of
Shanghai, the Shanghai Bund (外滩).

Standing on the Bund, crossing the Huangpu River, you will face the modern skyscrapers of
Lujiazui in Pudong.

Turning your back, you can see series of old building having a significant European influence,
that once housed numerous banks and trading houses. It was the rich and powerful center of the
foreign establishment in Shanghai from the 1860s to the 1930s.

I'm not sure if it's real or not, but my elders once told a funny story...

> Khu phố Tây (phố cũ) của Thượng Hải khi xưa là trung tâm tài chính của cả thành phố. Ở bến Thượng
> Hải, gần như tất cả cơ quan, ngân hàng đều chỉ có người Tây, tuyệt nhiên không có người Trung
> Quốc nào ở đó. Thậm chí, một số nơi còn gắn biển:
>
> ~Cấm chó và người Trung Quốc~

By the way, I got a feeling that we can imagine the city's historical development just by visiting
there.

The Puxi, where the Bund located, in the western of the Huangpu river, once was the center of
Shanghai. Now has become the historic core, contained much of the city's cultural legacy and
traditional city life.

The Pudong, where the skyscrapers located, in the eastern of the Huangpu river, has become a
symbol of modern development.

## Final

I visited Shanghai on 11th August, and left four days later, on 15th August; spent two days
participating Google I/O Connect China, and two days exploring the city.

The result? More than 20 kilometers walking, and tons of fun. 😊

Hoping one day to have another trip ya!
